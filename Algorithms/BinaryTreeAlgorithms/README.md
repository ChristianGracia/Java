# Binary Tree Algorithms

## Traversals

**level** - visit nodes on each level

**pre-order** - vist the root of every sub tree first

root -> left -> right

**post-order** - vist the root of every subtree last

left -> right -> root

**in order** - vist the left child, the root, then right child

left -> root -> right

this traversal is good to get the data sorted
