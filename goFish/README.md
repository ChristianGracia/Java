# Go Fish Game

In this game, two players are dealt 5 cards and they ask eachother for cards they already have to get a match and receive points

If a player asks for a card and the other player doesn't have it, they have to go fish (draw a card)

If a player asks for a card and is correct, they get a match, receieve points, and those cards are discarded

Game continues until deck runs out of cards
